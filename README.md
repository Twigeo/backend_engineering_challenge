# Data Engineering Challenge


Welcome to our Engineering Challenge repository üëã

If you've come across this repository, it's likely that you're taking part in our hiring process. Thank you for your time and effort. If that is not the case, please take a look at our current [openings](https://twigeo.com/career/) and apply! 

Please fork this repo before starting working on the challenge, read it thoroughly, and take your time thinking about a solution. Also, please fork this repository because the code will be evaluated on the fork.

This is a chance for us to collaborate and get to know each other on a more technical level. If you have any questions, please open an issue and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

Best wishes! 

## Challenge Scenario

At Twigeo we deal with a lot of data, one of your daily tasks is to collect, transform and store data from different sources and API's. 

In the context of this problem, and to keep things simple, we will ask you to collect data from a Google Spreadsheet, transform it and save it in a MySQL database.


## Challenge Objective

Your mission is to build a simple python application/script that fetches data from [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nRteMJI2lE05AFs4fSTxEvCXnbRLo1dmNjC1xC0IuZU/edit?usp=sharing) on a daily basis, produces an aggregated output of data and stores it in an organized, performant and scalable way. 

Before storing the data  you should calculate the following metrics and provide simple but meaningful insights.

- Which network usually has the most active users on a daily basis? (Provide trend graphs)
- Which network has the best ‚ÄúInstalls‚Äù to ‚ÄúSubscription started‚Äù conversion rate? Is it the same over time?
	
The output data should be stored in a MySQL database, use docker and/or docker-compose to run and manage your application and database.


#### Notes

We recommend that you consider the solution first before diving into implementation. We will assess not only whether your solution works, but also the following factors: 

+ Write code that is simple and easy to read.
+ Include a README.md file that describes how to build and run your code in detail.
+ Be consistent in your code.
+ Your code should be performant and scalable.

We want you to solve this challenge in Python 3. If you are thinking of using any other programming language please reach out to us first üôè.

Also if you have any problem please **open an issue**. 

Good luck and may the force be with you!

#### Extra points

If you are feeling creative feel free to consider any test cases you might find interesting. Remember this is a bonus, focus on delivering the solution first.
